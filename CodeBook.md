Data transformation
-------------------

The raw data sets are processed with run_analisys.R script to create a tidy data
set.

### Merge training and test sets

Test and training data (X_train.txt, X_test.txt), subject ids (subject_train.txt,
subject_test.txt) and activity ids (y_train.txt, y_test.txt) are merged to obtain
a single data set. Variables are labelled with the names assigned by original
collectors (features.txt).

### Extract mean and standard deviation variables

From the merged data set is extracted and intermediate data set with only the
values of estimated mean (variables with labels that contain "mean") and standard
deviation (variables with labels that contain "std").

### Use descriptive activity names

A new column is added to intermediate data set with the activity description.
Activity id column is used to look up descriptions in activity_labels.txt.

### Label variables appropriately

Labels given from the original collectors were changed:
* to obtain valid R names without parentheses, dashes and commas
* to obtain more descriptive labels

### Create a tidy data set

From the intermediate data set is created a final tidy data set where numeric
variables are averaged for each activity and each subject.

The tidy data set contains 10299 observations with 81 variables divided in:

*  an activity label (__Activity__): WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
*  an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (__Subject__): 1-30
*  a 79-feature vector with time and frequency domain signal variables (numeric)

The following table relates the 17 signals to the names used as prefix for the
variables names present in the data set. ".XYZ" denotes three variables, one for each axis.

Name                                  | Time domain                                 | Frequency domain
------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------
Body Acceleration                     | TimeDomain.BodyAcceleration.XYZ             | FrequencyDomain.BodyAcceleration.XYZ
Gravity Acceleration                  | TimeDomain.GravityAcceleration.XYZ          |
Body Acceleration Jerk                | TimeDomain.BodyAccelerationJerk.XYZ         | FrequencyDomain.BodyAccelerationJerk.XYZ
Body Angular Speed                    | TimeDomain.BodyAngularSpeed.XYZ             | FrequencyDomain.BodyAngularSpeed.XYZ
Body Angular Acceleration             | TimeDomain.BodyAngularAcceleration.XYZ      |
Body Acceleration Magnitude           | TimeDomain.BodyAccelerationMagnitude        | FrequencyDomain.BodyAccelerationMagnitude
Gravity Acceleration Magnitude        | TimeDomain.GravityAccelerationMagnitude     |
Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude      | TimeDomain.BodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude    | FrequencyDomain.BodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude
Body Angular Speed Magnitude          | TimeDomain.BodyAngularSpeedMagnitude        | FrequencyDomain.BodyAngularSpeedMagnitude
Body Angular Acceleration Magnitude   | TimeDomain.BodyAngularAccelerationMagnitude | FrequencyDomain.BodyAngularAccelerationMagnitude

For variables derived from mean and standard deviation estimation, the previous labels
are augmented with the terms "Mean" or "StandardDeviation".

The data set is written to the file Averages by Activities & Subjects.txt.
